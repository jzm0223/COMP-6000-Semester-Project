COMP-6000-001 (Spring 2024) Semester Project

## Problem Statement
For my project, I would like to develop a website that can connect local members of the community to other people in the area with similar interests. The website would allow a user to create an account, input their interests, and see nearby users with similar interests as well as their contact information so they can connect.

## Purpose and Scope
Local groups that meet for various activities, such as cricket, pickleball, disc golf, running, baking, or any other activity, can post their meeting on the Meetings page. The website will suggest meetings to new users and also allow them to create a new event if they don’t find one that meets their interests. I also plan to recommend new activities, based on overlapping interests with people in the community.

## Proposal

The website will be developed for the Auburn community. There will be various pages for users to interact with. 

### Design Requirements:

- Create account page: for new users to create an account
- Login page: for existing users to log in to their account
- Interests page: for existing users to add their interests to their profile
- Community page: for existing users to view other users in the community with similar interests
- Recommendations page: for existing users to view recommendations based on shared interests with other people in the community
- Meetings page: for groups to post their event details
- I will need a database to store the users’ account information.

### Development Requirements:

- XML: to store the data
- JSP: to implement login functionality
- MySql: to create the database
