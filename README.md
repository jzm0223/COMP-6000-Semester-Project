COMP-6000-001 (Spring 2024) Semester Project

## Problem Statement
For my project, I would like to develop a website that can connect local members of the community to other people in the area with similar interests. The website would allow a user to create an account, input their interests, and see nearby users with similar interests as well as their contact information so they can connect.

## Purpose and Scope
Local groups that meet for various activities, such as cricket, pickleball, disc golf, running, baking, or any other activity, can post their meeting on the Meetings page. The website will suggest meetings to new users and also allow them to create a new event if they donâ€™t find one that meets their interests. I also plan to recommend new activities, based on overlapping interests with people in the community.
